# BangleGotchi 🐷  
A virtual pet for the Bangle.js 1 – made for kids.

## 🌟 About the App

**BangleGotchi** is a simple virtual pet game designed especially for children using the **Bangle.js 1** smartwatch. Inspired by classic Tamagotchi-style interactions, the app introduces young users to the concept of responsibility and care for a living being in a playful and safe way.

The pet responds to movement, touch, and user interactions such as feeding, cleaning, playing, and letting it sleep.

## 🎯 Purpose

This app was developed with two main goals in mind:

- **Educational**: To help children understand basic needs and emotional well-being by interacting with a digital creature.
- **Therapeutic**: It can be used in children’s hospitals to **distract and reduce anxiety** during treatments by offering an engaging and calming interaction.

The pig never “dies” – if its needs are neglected, it simply falls unconscious and can always be revived. This ensures that the experience remains gentle and non-traumatizing, even for very young users.

## ⚙️ Features

- Four needs to care for: **hunger, cleanliness, energy, and affection**
- Face expression changes based on mood and activity
- Accelerometer-based play (shaking wakes and entertains it)
- Inactivity makes the pet restless
- Visual menu to feed, clean, pet, or put it to sleep
- Emergency state triggers vibrations and a visual alert
- Child-friendly design with no failure states
